        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>I am pursuing a degree in Web Develpoment, and I am really excited about it. This will be my second Bachelors degree. My first being in Marriage and Family Studies. The timing is right to pursue and learn somthing new. </p>
        <p>I love to paint, read and listen to books, hike, backpack and play with my 3 little kids. </p>
        <p>I love the idea of being able to work from home! That is the most appealing thing about a career in Web Development. To be home when my kids are home from school, while still being able to have a professional career. Its my dream!</p>
