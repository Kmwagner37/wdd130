                    <h2>Hello Friends,</h2>
                    <p> My name is Krystal, and I love art. Especially watercolor. I find inspiration
                        from nature. The resilient trees, delicate flowers, rich colors at sunrise and sunset. Walking
                        down an endless trail full of sounds, and diverse scenery brings me so much joy. Wife to Spencer
                        and Mother to Finnley (7) Aven (5) and Everett (3). We love playing games, jumping on the
                        trampoline and camping as a family. December 2021 changed our lives forever when our little Aven
                        was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Since then it has been in a whirlwind of learning, medical
                        devices and doctor appointments. Having Type 1 diabetes means that her body is not producing
                        insulin. She needs a pump, insulin and a CGM to monitor her blood sugar levels. The expenses add
                        up quickly. This art page is dedicated to those families of Type 1 Diabetes children. I know the
                        emotional, and financial weight is a constant companion to those parents. I want to help. A
                        portion of the proceeds will go directly to a family of a child with T1D. I believe in the power
                        of one. One person can make a difference, use their influence to help others. This is how I
                        choose to help. </p>
